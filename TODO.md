- Simulate computational power per denom, impose a limit where probability 
increases of orphan.
- When computational power is in, introduce 4th denom strategy which favours 10s
and 100s.
- Rerun all simulations for 10 years and produce charts.
- Add in configuration options through command line only.
- Split up the binary into a library
- Create a new binary which is meant for RingCT PoS staking with all it's 
differences from Zerocoin PoS.
